## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Real-Time Task Organization

The system employs a carefully designed task hierarchy that balances real-time requirements with system functionality. Higher priority tasks handle safety-critical operations, while lower priority tasks manage user interaction and system maintenance.

#### Task Design Rationale

**Critical Real-Time Layer (Priority 4)**: Notifier tasks that handle immediate hardware interrupts and time-critical events. These tasks have the highest priority to ensure deterministic response to hardware events.

**Core System Layer (Priority 5)**: Essential system services including train control, communication, and coordination. These tasks form the backbone of the train control system and run at high priority to maintain real-time guarantees.

**Application Layer (Priorities 7-10)**: Application-specific tasks like sensor polling and user interface that can tolerate some scheduling delay while still maintaining system responsiveness.

**Background Layer (Priority 31)**: The idle task runs when no other tasks require CPU time, managing power consumption and system maintenance.

### 2.2 Communication Architecture

The system implements a publish-subscribe messaging pattern that decouples task interactions while maintaining real-time guarantees.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Message Flow"
        SENSORS[Sensor Triggers]
        SWITCHES[Switch States]

## 3. Conductor Module

The Conductor module functions as the central traffic control authority, orchestrating safe multi-train operations through intelligent block management, signal control, and optimal pathfinding. It ensures that trains can operate autonomously while maintaining safety through exclusive track access control.

### 3.1 Block-Based Safety System

The track layout is divided into discrete, self-contained blocks that serve as the fundamental units of train safety and coordination. Each block represents a section of track with well-defined boundaries and exclusive access control.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Block Architecture"
        subgraph "Block 2"
            A_ENTRY[Entry Sensor<br/>C13, E8]
            A_INTERNAL[Internal Components<br/>â€¢ Empty]
            A_EXIT[Exit Sensors<br/>E7, C14]
            A_ENTRY --> A_INTERNAL --> A_EXIT
        end

        subgraph "Block 7"
            B_ENTRY[Entry Sensors<br/>E7, D8]
            B_INTERNAL[Internal Components<br/>â€¢ Empty]
            B_EXIT[Exit Sensors<br/>E8, D7]
            B_ENTRY --> B_INTERNAL --> B_EXIT
        end

        subgraph "Block 12"
            C_ENTRY[Entry Sensors<br/>D7, D6, E9, D10]
            C_INTERNAL[Internal Components<br/>â€¢ Switch 9, Switch 8]
            C_EXIT[Exit Sensors<br/>D8, D5, E10, D9]
            C_ENTRY --> C_INTERNAL --> C_EXIT
        end
    end

    A_EXIT -.-> B_ENTRY
    A_EXIT -.-> C_ENTRY
    B_EXIT -.-> C_ENTRY

    subgraph "Block State Management"
        STATE[Block State<br/>â€¢ Owner Train ID<br/>â€¢ Reservation Time<br/>â€¢ Physical Occupancy<br/>â€¢ Entry Point]
    end
```

#### Block Design Principles

**Exclusive Ownership**: Only one train may reserve a block at any time, preventing collisions by ensuring trains cannot occupy the same track section simultaneously.

**Complete Containment**: All possible paths between any two boundary sensors remain entirely within the block, guaranteeing that trains cannot accidentally exit into uncontrolled territory.

**Switch Authority**: The train that owns a block has exclusive control over all switches within that block, preventing conflicting switch commands that could derail trains.

**Independent Detection**: Physical occupancy detection operates independently from reservations, providing redundant safety verification through sensor networks.

### 3.2 Signal System Integration

The system implements a three-aspect signal system that automatically regulates train speeds based on track conditions ahead. **Note**: For TC1, this system is not enforced but provides the infrastructure for future expansion.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Signal Aspects"
        GREEN[ðŸŸ¢ GREEN<br/>Clear Ahead<br/>Normal Speed]

    end

        STOP[Emergency Stop<br/>Safety Override]
    end

    GREEN --> PROCEED
    YELLOW --> REDUCE
    RED --> STOP
```

### 3.3 Intelligent Pathfinding

The conductor employs sophisticated pathfinding algorithms based on Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, enhanced with railway-specific considerations including reversals, block awareness, and safety constraints.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Pathfinding Process"
        REQUEST[Path Request<br/>From: Current Position<br/>To: Destination]

        end

        subgraph "Railway Enhancements"

        end

        RESULT[Path Result<br/>â€¢ Node sequence<br/>â€¢ Switch settings<br/>â€¢ Reversal points]
    end

    REQUEST --> GRAPH
    GRAPH --> COSTS
    COSTS --> DIJKSTRA
    DIJKSTRA --> REVERSAL
    REVERSAL --> BLOCKS
    BLOCKS --> SWITCHES
    SWITCHES --> RESULT
```

#### Pathfinding Enhancements

**Reversal Safety Validation**: Before allowing a train to reverse, the system verifies that sufficient track length exists both behind the train (minimum 5000mm traveled) and ahead (minimum 5000mm available) to safely execute the maneuver.

**Block-Aware Exit Selection**: When a train is positioned at a block entry sensor, the pathfinding system traces through the block's internal switches using their current positions to determine which specific exit sensor the train will actually reach, rather than assuming a default exit.

**Cost-Based Optimization**: The algorithm assigns costs to different path options:
- **Base Cost**: Physical distance in millimeters
- **Reversal Penalty**: Additional 5000mm cost equivalent to discourage unnecessary reversals
- **Block Conflicts**: Higher costs for paths requiring busy blocks

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Example Block Tracing"
        ENTRY[Block Entry<br/>Sensor E1]
        SW1[Switch 1<br/>Current: CURVED]

## 4. Train Module

The Train module represents the brain of each autonomous train, implementing physics-based motion control, learning systems, and navigation capabilities. Each train operates as an independent agent while coordinating with the central conductor for safe multi-train operations.

### 4.1 Autonomous Operating Modes

The train system supports three distinct operating modes, each tailored for different operational requirements and levels of autonomy.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Operating Modes"
        subgraph "Manual Mode"
            MAN_NAV[Navigation: Direct Commands]
            MAN_SPEED[Speed: User Controlled]
            MAN_PATH[Path: None]
        end

        subgraph "Waypoint Mode"
            WAY_NAV[Navigation<br/> Automatic Pathfinding]
            WAY_SPEED[Speed<br/> Signal-Based + Physics]
            WAY_PATH[Path: Calculated Routes]
        end

        subgraph "Road Mode"
        ROAD_NAV[Navigation: Signal Following]
            ROAD_SPEED[Speed: Signal-Based Only]
            ROAD_PATH[Path: Reactive Navigation]
        end
    end

    subgraph "Mode Transitions"
        USER[User Command] --> MAN_NAV
        DEST[Destination Set] --> WAY_NAV
        SIGNAL[Signal Mode] --> ROAD_NAV
    end

```

#### Mode Characteristics

**Manual Mode**: Provides direct human control over train operations, used for testing, maintenance, or situations requiring human intervention. The train responds immediately to user commands without autonomous decision-making.

**Waypoint Mode**: Implements full autonomous navigation where trains intelligently navigate to specified destinations. This mode combines pathfinding, collision avoidance, signal compliance, and precise stopping control.

**Road Mode**: Enables signal-following behavior without predetermined destinations, similar to real railway operations where trains proceed based on signal states and traffic conditions.

### 4.2 Physics-Based Kinematic Modeling

The heart of the train control system lies in its sophisticated physics engine that models each train's unique characteristics with exceptional precision using fixed-point arithmetic.

```mermaid

    ACCEL --> PREDICTION
    DECEL --> CONTROL
    STOP_DIST --> CONTROL
    STOP_TIME --> CONTROL

    POSITION --> PREDICTION
    PREDICTION --> CONTROL
```

#### Precision Engineering

The system achieves remarkable precision through several design decisions:

**Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Using 64-bit integers with a 10^8 scale factor provides 8 decimal places of precision, ensuring deterministic calculations without floating-point uncertainties that could compromise real-time guarantees.

**Individual Train Profiles**: Each train maintains its own complete kinematic model, accounting for differences in motor characteristics, weight distribution, wheel condition, and other factors that affect performance.

**Multi-Parameter Modeling**: The system tracks velocity, acceleration, deceleration, stopping distance, and stopping time for each of the 28 possible speed levels, creating a comprehensive performance profile.

### 4.3 Adaptive Calibration System

The system continuously learns and adapts to each train's characteristics through sophisticated offline calibration experiments. This adaptive approach ensures optimal performance as trains age and conditions change.

#### 4.3.1 Velocity Calibration Methodology

The velocity calibration process uses a precisely measured track loop to determine each train's actual speed characteristics at different control levels.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Velocity Measurement Process"

    end

    START -.-> APPROACH
```

**Key Insights**:
- Multiple loops provide statistical accuracy and account for minor variations
- Proper speed approach sequences ensure consistent train behavior
- The known loop distance provides a precise measurement baseline

#### 4.3.2 Acceleration Analysis

Acceleration calibration employs a sophisticated two-scenario algorithm that accounts for the reality that trains may complete their acceleration before reaching the measurement endpoint.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Two-Scenario Algorithm"
        SETUP[Setup: Train at C13<br/>Initial Speed v1<br/>Target Speed v2]

        EQ2[v_obs = distance / time]
        EQ3[Acc = delta-v / delta-t]
    end
```

#### 4.3.3 Stop Distance Optimization

The stop distance calibration uses a binary search algorithm to find the optimal timing for issuing stop commands, achieving precise stopping at target locations.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Binary Search Process"
        INIT[Initialize Search Range<br/>Estimate travel time<br/>Min delay = 0<br/>Max delay = estimated_time]

        UPDATE[Update Delay<br/>delay = #40;min + max#41; / 2]

        COMPLETE[Store Stop Distance<br/>total distance minus distance before stop]
    end

    INIT --> TEST
    TEST --> EVALUATE
    EVALUATE -->|E7 not triggered| TOO_EARLY
    EVALUATE -->|E7 triggered & overshot| TOO_LATE
    EVALUATE -->|E7 triggered & stopped| PERFECT

    TOO_EARLY --> CONVERGE
    TOO_LATE --> CONVERGE
    PERFECT --> COMPLETE

    CONVERGE -->|No| UPDATE
    CONVERGE -->|Yes| COMPLETE
    UPDATE --> TEST
```

#### 4.3.4 Deceleration Derivation

Deceleration values are calculated using fundamental physics equations, deriving precise values from the empirically measured velocities and stopping distances.

**Physics Foundation**: Using the kinematic equation vÂ² = vâ‚€Â² + 2ad, where:
- v = final velocity (0 for stopping)
- vâ‚€ = initial velocity (measured)
- a = acceleration (negative for deceleration)
- d = stopping distance (measured)

**Calculation**: Solving for deceleration gives us: **a = -vâ‚€Â² / (2d)**

This physics-based approach ensures consistency between measured stopping performance and the mathematical model used for real-time predictions.

### 4.4 Real-Time Control Integration

The train's autonomous operation seamlessly integrates all calibrated parameters into real-time decision making, creating a responsive and intelligent control system.

```

#### Waypoint Mode Intelligence

In waypoint mode, the train demonstrates autonomous intelligence through:

**1. Dynamic Path Management**: Continuously monitors path validity and requests new routes when needed

**2. Automatic Reversal Execution**: Detects reversal points in the path and executes reversals seamlessly without human intervention

**3. Signal Compliance**: Automatically adjusts speed and stopping behavior based on track signal states

**4. Predictive Position Tracking**: Maintains continuous awareness of location using sensor fusion and motion prediction

**5. Safety-First Decision Making**: Prioritizes safety over efficiency in all navigation decisions

#### Precision Stopping System

The stopping control integrates multiple data sources to achieve millimeter-precision stops:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Stopping Calculation"
        SPEED[Current Speed<br/>Physical measurement]
        MODEL[Kinematic Model<br/>Stop distance data]
        MARGIN[Safety Margin<br/>Conservative buffer]
        PHYSICS[Physics Engine<br/>Real-time prediction]
    end

    subgraph "Decision Process"
        DISTANCE[Distance to Target<br/>Continuous calculation]
        TIMING[Stop Command Timing<br/>Optimal delay calculation]
        EXECUTION[Command Execution<br/>Hardware interface]
    end

    SPEED --> DISTANCE
    MODEL --> DISTANCE
    MARGIN --> DISTANCE
    PHYSICS --> TIMING
    DISTANCE --> TIMING
    TIMING --> EXECUTION
```

## 5. Miscellaneous Systems

### 5.1 Broken Sensor Tracking

**File**: `src/uapps/include/marklin/common/blacklisted_sensors_list.h`

The system maintains a compile-time list of non-functional sensors that should be excluded from pathfinding and sensor processing:

```c
// Track A broken sensors
BROKEN_SENSOR(MARKLIN_TRACK_TYPE_A, "B10")
BROKEN_SENSOR(MARKLIN_TRACK_TYPE_A, "B9")
BROKEN_SENSOR(MARKLIN_TRACK_TYPE_A, "C2")

// Track B broken sensors
BROKEN_SENSOR(MARKLIN_TRACK_TYPE_B, "C12")
```

**Usage**: The `BROKEN_SENSOR` macro is defined differently in various contexts to:
- Exclude sensors from pathfinding algorithms
- Skip sensor validation in topology
- Generate runtime blacklist arrays
- Provide debugging information

### 5.2 Edge Resistance Compensation

**File**: `src/uapps/include/marklin/common/edge_resistance_list.h`

Track segments have varying conditions affecting train performance. The system compensates using resistance coefficients:

```c
// Resistance coefficient format (fixed-point with scale 1000):
// 1000 = normal resistance (1.0)
// 1200 = 20% higher resistance
// 600 = 40% lower resistance

// Track A resistance configurations
TRACK_RESISTANCE(MARKLIN_TRACK_TYPE_A, "BR8", "D9", 1200)    // 20% higher
TRACK_RESISTANCE(MARKLIN_TRACK_TYPE_A, "D9", "E12", 1200)
TRACK_RESISTANCE(MARKLIN_TRACK_TYPE_A, "E12", "D11", 1200)
TRACK_RESISTANCE(MARKLIN_TRACK_TYPE_A, "D11", "C16", 1200)

// Track B resistance configurations
TRACK_RESISTANCE(MARKLIN_TRACK_TYPE_B, "MR1", "A9", 600)     // 40% lower
```

**Applications**:
- **Velocity Calibration**: Adjust expected speeds on high-resistance curves
- **Stop Distance Adjustment**: Account for braking effectiveness variations

### 5.3 Topology Server

The topology server maintains the track layout graph and provides distance calculation services:

#### Services Provided
- **Distance Calculation**: Between any two track nodes
- **Resistance Lookup**: Resistance for track segments
- **Path Validation**: Verify track connectivity
- **Node Information**: Type, connections, properties

### 5.4 Message Queue System

**File**: `src/uapps/include/marklin/msgqueue/msgqueue.h`

Provides reliable inter-task communication with the following features:

#### Message Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    marklin_msgqueue_event_type_t event_type;  // Message classification
    u32 data_size;                             // Payload size
    u64 timestamp;                             // Creation time
    u8 data[MARKLIN_MSGQUEUE_MAX_DATA_SIZE];   // Payload data
} marklin_msgqueue_message_t;
```

#### Queue Management
- **Per-subscriber Queues**: Each subscriber has dedicated message buffer
- **Overflow Handling**: Configurable buffer sizes with overflow detection
- **Nonblocking Operations**: Tasks can poll without blocking

## 6. Calibration Data Storage

### 6.1 Raw Calibration Data Repository Location

The system's calibration data is stored within the main source code repository in a structured format that enables version control and reproducible builds.

**Primary Calibration Data Directory:**
```
src/uapps/marklin/train/
â”œâ”€â”€ model_defaults.c          # Raw calibration data storage
â”œâ”€â”€ model.c                   # Kinematic model implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ calibration.c             # Calibration algorithms
â””â”€â”€ offline_*.c               # Automated calibration experiments
```

**Calibration Data File:** `src/uapps/marklin/train/model_defaults.c`

This file contains the persistent calibration data for all supported trains in the system.

### 6.3 Supported Train Models

The system currently maintains calibration data for the following train models:

| Train ID | Calibration Status | Speed Levels Calibrated | Data Quality |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **14** | Fully Calibrated | 12-27 (16 levels) | Complete velocity, acceleration, stopping |
| **16** | Partially Calibrated | 17-27 (11 levels) | Velocity only |
| **18** | Partially Calibrated | 10-27 (18 levels) | Mixed calibration data |
| **15** | Uncalibrated | 0 levels | Default values only |
| **17** | Uncalibrated | 0 levels | Default values only |
| **55** | Uncalibrated | 0 levels | Default values only |

### 6.4 Calibration Data Format

Raw calibration values are stored as fixed-point integers with a scale factor of 10^8, providing 8 decimal places of precision:

**Example Train 14 Calibration Data (Speed Level 17):**
```c
{278584624, 46919, 1014516, 386, 275, 0, 0, 0}
//    ^        ^        ^      ^    ^
//    |        |        |      |    â””â”€ Stop time: 275 ticks
//    |        |        |      â””â”€â”€â”€â”€ Stop distance: 386 mm
//    |        |        â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Deceleration: 10.14516 mm/tickÂ²
//    |        â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Acceleration: 0.00046919 mm/tickÂ²
//    â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Velocity: 2.78584624 mm/tick
```

### 6.5 Data Collection and Updates

Calibration data is collected through automated offline experiments and updated in the source code:

1. **Offline Velocity Calibration**: Loop-based measurements for steady-state velocity
2. **Offline Acceleration Calibration**: Two-scenario algorithm for acceleration profiles
3. **Offline Stop Distance Calibration**: Binary search optimization for precise stopping
4. **Data Integration**: Results are manually integrated into `model_defaults.c` after validation

This approach ensures that calibration improvements are version-controlled and can be shared across development environments.
